# React Authentication

This is a showcase of how I implement authorization in a React application. Many say that authentication and authorization is the hardest part of building a web application. So I studied how to do it right especially in a React application.

For the authorization part, every user has a role and every role has different permissions. Those roles are:

- ADMIN: READ, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE
- MODERATOR: READ, CREATE
- USER: READ

This project is a simple CRUD application that allows you to create, read, update and delete Pokemons. You can also check the authorization by interacting with the Pokemon CRUD.

This project is built with:

- React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Query, React Router, Zod, Hook Form, MobX.
